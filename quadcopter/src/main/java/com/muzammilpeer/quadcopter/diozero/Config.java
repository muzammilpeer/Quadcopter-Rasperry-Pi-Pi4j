/**
 * <b>This class contains some useful information regarding configuration properties
 * needed to deal with some specific aspects of the utilization of the framework.</b>
 * 
 * <p>As an example, an important difference for the framework is regarding the i2c bus number.
 * Between the model B Rev 1 and Rev 2 versions of the Pi, they changed the signals
 * that where sent to Pin 3 and Pin 5 on the GPIO header. This changed the device 
 * number that needs to be used with i2c from 0 to 1.
 * By setting the the correct model of Raspberry Pi executing the program (with the 
 * {@link Config#setRaspberryPiModel(RaspberryPiModel)} method), you can easily avoid any problem
 * regarding this selection of the right i2c bus number for your Pi.</p>
